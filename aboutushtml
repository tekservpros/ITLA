	<span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Our History</strong></span>
</p>

<p>
	In 1996, a small group of African American lesbian and gay friends held a picnic over Labor Day weekend to celebrate their unique experience in Atlanta&rsquo;s LGBT community. Each year, the group grew with others from the community and neighboring cities. As the celebration grew, ITLA and Atlanta Black Pride were born. ITLA is a non-profit, volunteer led 501(c) 3 organization and official organizer of Atlanta Black Pride that is often considered the jewel for Black Prides across the United States. ITLA is known for their signature events, which brings a level of quality programming that is superior to none. Each year, ITLA makes great strides to create more events during Labor Day weekend and throughout the year in response to the needs of our LGTBQIA community.

<p>
	The annual Atlanta Black Pride celebration now attracts gay people of color from every part of the nation, as well as from countries abroad. Atlanta has one of the largest Black populations in the country and has become a welcoming, melting pot of diverse communities. ITLA has been rolling out the red carpet for our LGBTQIA community and its visitors in celebration of our values, contributions, and PRIDE. As we have continued to evolve, ITLA has also been able to provide year-round programs and events that promote community leadership, education, healthy living, self-empowerment, economic growth, and political involvement.
